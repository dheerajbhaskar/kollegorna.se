    <h3>What it's like working here</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>You have big opportunities to influence your job and how we work.</li>
      <li>You'll enjoy a creative and smooth work environment.</li>
      <li>We're the best colleagues.</li>
      <li>Remote work = OK. We have our main office in Stockholm but you're free to work from wherever you like.</li>
      <li>Leave no colleague behind! You'll never end up on a long term contract on your own at some clients' office.</li>
      <li>Personal Development Days – Every sixth week everyone can choose a topic to develop their skills within during three days: thursday, friday and monday.</li>
      <li>Company Development Days – When we see it necessary to learn new stuff we take time to do that. How often and how long differs. On the Company Development Days we pick a mutual thing to learn in contrast to the Personal Development Days where you pick freely what you want.</li>
      <li>Overtime is our enemy and should not exist. You work 9-5. Our employees have been working around eight hours ordered overtime since the company was founded in april 2010. If you can't stop doing web stuff then go work on some open source project or something…</li>
      <li>Health benefit, insurance, doctors appointment during work work hours… That you're feeling well is a condition to do a good days work.</li>
      <li>Pension savings (according to swedish standards ITP1/ITP2)</li>
      <li>Conference trips. We like to see the world and make sure to go somewhere on a yearly basis.</li>

      <li>Up to 350 kr (approx €38, $50 or £30) each month to spend on stuff that makes you a better designer or developer. Upgrade your GitHub account? Enroll Codeschool or Treehouse? Fill your ebook reader with an unhealthy amount of ebooks? It's your choice.</li>
      <li>Your own stapler. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd4fj9Efl4s">To avoid fires</a>.</li>
      <li>A MacBook Pro, MacBook Air or whatever computer you prefer.</li>
    </ul>
